This repo is a work-in-progress repo where I store my web page.
It is really a sandbox where I try out different technologies
and so may change radically from one push to the next.

I do not recommend forking or cloning this repo as there are better
references out there to the techonologies I try out:

- https://angular.io/
- https://material.angular.io/
- https://www.djangoproject.com/
- https://getbootstrap.com/
